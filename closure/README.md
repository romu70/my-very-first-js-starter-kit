# Very first javascript starter kit

My software development background is not Javascript. As a developer, I grew up with C++, then Java and C#. Strong typed, classes, inheritance were some things I've worked with for years.

When I first saw a Js piece of code, my first thought was: "I don't understand anything at this code". And as learning is always a good thing, I decided to learn about Js. This repository is a way for me to keep a trace of
my learning. But I hope this can server anyone who, like me, is a Js beginner.

I don't start learning Js with any library or framework. Neither I start from back end or front end. Indeed, my starting point comes from the language fundamentals: how do I create an object? how about implementing encapsulation? what about modularity?
or unit testing? are some very basic questions I want to answer to be able to start a serious piece of software.

The ideas exposed here don't pretend to be exhaustive. I've understood there are often many ways to code a single idea with Js. In such cases, I try to take the best practises read from famous Js fellows. I'll try to publish some links where these examples come from.

This repository is create in early 2016, so all examples are ES6 only. All examples provided in this repository can be run with NodeJs 5.x.

There is an order to read and test the source code provided here:
- [object-creation](https://github.com/romu70/very-first-js-starter-kit/tree/master/object-creation) is where all begins
- [modules](https://github.com/romu70/very-first-js-starter-kit/tree/master/modules)
- [hoisting](https://github.com/romu70/very-first-js-starter-kit/tree/master/hoisting)
