# Object creation

In Js, there are basically 3 ways to create objects:
- Object literal notation (something close to Json)
- Constructor function
- The new ES6 "class" keyword.

I read a lot about objects in Js and came to the conclusion that the best way to create Js objects is to use the literal notation and write factory functions. This is simple, plain Js, prevent having to use "new". A lot of those principles are taken from @ericelliott writing. Hope to do things well enough.
