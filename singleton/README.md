# Singleton

Here are some codes to implement the singleton pattern. A singleton is an object only one instance can be created within the software which uses it. The first code *singleton1.js* shows some code found on StackOverflow. This code is sooo long and complicated!
*singleton2.js* is a proposal of a more concise and simple way to implement this pattern using IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression). *singleton3* shows how to use this same pattern within a module.
